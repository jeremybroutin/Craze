# Craze
Craze allows users to create their own closet and provides automatic outfit recommendations depending on multiple factors.
Here is an exhaustive list of existing features of Craze app:
- Craze uses the OpenWeather API to return the weather information based on the user's location
- a recommendation engine fetches Core Data objects (clothes) based on several attributes (used in NSPredicates)
- the home page displays the recommended clothes to the user with the option to refresh or validate them
- the user can easily add and edit clothes objects using its camera or the phone gallery
- all clothes are displayed in a collection view (closet)
- when a recommendation is validated, it is stored as an Outfit (Core Data Object)
- all outfits and the data at which they were chosen (validated) by the user are available in a TableView Controller

Many more features and recommendation engine enhancements are planned and will be added progressively over the coming months.
